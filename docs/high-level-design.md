# High-Level Design Document - Order Management System

## Architecture Overview

The Order Management System is a modern frontend application built with Next.js 15:

### System Components
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: React Context and local state
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router for modern navigation

### Component Flow
```
User Interaction → React Components → State Management → UI Updates
```

### Page Navigation
```
User Navigation → Next.js Router → Page Components → UI Rendering
```

## Component Breakdown

### Client Components
- **Customer Portal**: Order placement and tracking
- **Staff Dashboard**: Internal order management
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive system oversight

### API Layers
- **Routes**: HTTP endpoint definitions
- **Controllers**: Request/response handling
- **Services**: Business logic implementation
- **Data Access**: Database operations

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `users`: System users with roles
- `customers`: Customer information
- `products`: Product catalog with inventory
- `orders`: Order records with status tracking
- `order_items`: Order line items
- `order_status_history`: Audit trail for status changes

## API Contract

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Auth Required |
|----------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | User authentication | No |
| `/api/orders` | GET | List orders | Yes |
| `/api/orders` | POST | Create order | Yes |
| `/api/orders/:id` | GET | Get order details | Yes |
| `/api/orders/:id/status` | PATCH | Update order status | Staff+ |
| `/api/products` | GET | List products | No |
| `/api/customers` | GET | List customers | Staff+ |
| `/api/reports/orders/export` | GET | Export orders CSV | Admin |

## Security & Observability

### Authentication & Authorization
- NextAuth.js integration with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control (Customer, Staff, Admin)
- Protected API routes with middleware validation

### Monitoring
- Request logging with pino
- Health check endpoints
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance monitoring

## Deployment Topology

### Development
- Local PostgreSQL database
- Next.js dev server on port 3000
- Fastify API server on port 8000

### Production
- Frontend: Vercel deployment
- Backend: Railway/AWS deployment
- Database: Managed PostgreSQL service
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions pipeline

This design ensures scalability, maintainability, and security while meeting all functional requirements outlined in the specification.
